Arc GCS Provides an [`Arc`](https://github.com/stavro/arc) storage back-end for [`Google Cloud Storage`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

## Installation

Add the latest stable release to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:arc_gcs, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.


### Configuration

config :arc,
  storage: Arc.Storage.GCS,
  bucket: "gcs-bucket-name"

config :goth,
  json: "/path/to/json" |> Path.expand |> File.read!
```


### Tests

To run the tests you need to set the following

-   `ARC_TEST_BUCKET` - e.g `gcs-bucket-name`
